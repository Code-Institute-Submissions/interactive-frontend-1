# Interactive-frontend
The objective of this project is to create a single-page application using google maps. The users are able to find places of interest such as hotels, restaurants and attractions located at Singapore.

## Demo
This single-page application can be viewed via this [link]( https://chanhelmy.github.io/interactive-frontend/).

## UX
As a tourist, I want to be able to search for places of interest so that I can visit them. As a user, i want to be able to search for restaurants and hotels so that I can find the rating for these places via the info window on the marker. I have also included an initial wireframe for this single-page application.

## Features
The user is able to search places of interest by entering in the text box. On the page, the user is able to filter that there are five places as references such as the Sultan Mosque and Singapore Polytechnic.

### Features left to implement
To be able to have the picture of the place searched. Have wikipedia extract on the location.
